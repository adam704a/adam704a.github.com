Hello! I am Adam. I am a digital health advisor for RTI International.  I work on projects for clients like United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In here, you'll find random stories from project work, my impressions of conferences and other professional events that I have tuned into and other adventures in implementation. 


Thanks for reading!
