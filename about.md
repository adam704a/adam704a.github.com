I spend a lot my days working to solve problems for global health projects. I do this mostly by advising these projects on their use of technology.  I do this for clients such as United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). There are others too, but these are the biggies.

In my day to day work, I find myself not having the time or even the place to document some of the work that I do. So, that's why I started this thing. In here, you'll find a nice assortment of stories from the field, my impressions of conferences and other professional events that I have attended, and other reflections on digital health. 


Thanks for reading!
