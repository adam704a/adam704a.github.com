Hello! I am Adam. I am a digital health advisor for RTI International.  I work on projects for clients like United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In here, you'll find a nice assortment of stories from the field, my impressions of conferences and other professional events that I have attended, and other reflections on digital health. 


Thanks for reading!
