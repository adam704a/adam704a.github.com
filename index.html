          <h3>My name is.</h3>

<p>My name is Adam Preston. While at one point in my life I thought I had a pretty unique name (though now I am not sure why that was).  , as of late I have now come across a few others out there bearing my name.  Through my attempts with modern day social networking, I have learned that there is one fellow going by my name somewhere in the U.K., from what I can tell he is a student, and a pot smoking one at that.  There is another dude in Australia doing computer administration (or some damn thing) who is also taking advantage of my strong name.  I even came across another dude in southern California selling real estate, no doubt successfully on what I have built (incidentally this man paid me off handsomely to have adampreston.com on the internet).  What you must realize is that this site, the one you are on right now, is the authoritative source on all things Adam Preston.</p>


<h3>My Politics</h3>

<p>I am not exactly sure why I am telling you this, I don't even know you.  I am not a political person.  However, I think we are all in this world together (whether we admit it or not).  Consequently, we should stop to reflect every once in a while on where we as an individual fit in, to our neighborhood, to our city, to our state, to our country and to our world. We don't do what we do by ourselves.</p>

<h3>My Floundering Squash Career</h3>

<p>I picked up a squash racquet when I was fourteen years old.  It wasn't long after that when I realized that this was my calling, I was to become a professional squash player.  A little while after that, I came to understand that squash players make virtually no money. I am not saying this is to explain why I am not on the PSA tour, but we can all agree that it is a convenient excuse. </p>



<h3>My Future</h3>

<p>I am not saying that I am a Make-A-Wish Child or anything but I think its good to have goals.  These are mine:
	
<ul>
	<li>Ride across the country on a motorcycle</li>
	<li>Get a cartoon published in the New Yorker</li>
</ul>
